# Nanoshell

a mini implementation of the minishell, a limited but very enriching project, it serves as the basis for other projects, as a basis for the shell and for a simple implementation of the pipe.

```bash
# Clone the project and access the folder
git clone https://github.com/DeykyPinheiro/nanoshell && cd nanoshell/

# compiles "./a.out" into "./nanoshell"
make

# Run the program
run

# Write any shell command like
echo "hello minishell"

# Quit the program
exit

# Clean output objects with
make fclean
```
